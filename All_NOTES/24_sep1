console.log([] == []) // false
Arrays are reference types. Each [] creates a new array in memory.
Two different references are never equal unless compared with === or == to the same object.

console.log([] == ![]) //true
Step 1: ![] → false (because [] is truthy).
Step 2: [] == false → During loose equality, [] becomes '' (empty string).
Step 3: '' == false → converts '' to number 0 and false to 0.
Step 4: 0 == 0 → ✅ true.
